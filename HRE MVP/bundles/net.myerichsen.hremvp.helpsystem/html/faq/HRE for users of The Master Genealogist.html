	<h1>HRE for users of The Master Genealogist</h1>

	<p>HRE is designed to provide an onward path for genealogists who
		currently use the now-discontinued program The Master Genealogist
		(TMG), previously sold by Wholly Genes.</p>

	<p>We are working towards providing the ability to import existing
		TMG projects without data loss.  For standard TMG setups, we aim
		to provide equivalent or better functionality than TMG.</p>

	<p>But many things will work differently, as HRE is not simply a
		re-write of TMG but is an entirely new and more powerful program. In
		particular, the graphical user interface (GUI) will be different, as
		will the sentence-creation and reporting functionality. We hope to be
		able to provide import-translation tools that will convert a TMG
		project (v8.5 and later) into the new HRE formats, so as to maintain
		so far as possible expected sentence outputs.</p>

	<p>Existing TMG users should note that HRE is an ongoing project
		and that even if the project is successful fully-operational software
		will not be available for some time.  In the meantime, we
		recommend continuing to run your existing TMG program, and keeping
		your data up-to-date ready to transfer once HRE has been released.</p>

	<p>If you need to move away from TMG immediately, then HRE is not
		for you, and you will need to select one of the available commercial
		genealogy options. Unfortunately that will mean sacrificing
		significant functionality as there is at present nothing that can
		match TMG&rsquo;s feature-set.</p>
		
	<h2>Wholly Genes, Inc.</h2>

	<p>HRE is being written from scratch, and will not directly use or
		copy the program code within the Wholly Genes product TMG.</p>

	<p>However, we recognize that in order to ensure compatibility with
		existing TMG user data, there will necessarily be some similarities
		between TMG and HRE, including underlying data structures, default
		sentence structures, modes of operation, and potentially &ldquo;look
		and feel&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>We are very pleased to be able to say that Wholly Genes (Bob
		Velke) has kindly granted us permission to reuse any aspects of TMG
		(other than the source code) for which they control the copyright. As
		HRE will be an entirely new program, we have not sought permission to
		re-use or de-compile TMG source code.</p>

	<p>Ownership of copyright in some elements of TMG, including
		translations and some timelines, remains with the original authors and
		if there is any benefit in our reusing such third-party content, we
		will make separate arrangements.</p>

	<p>We are most grateful to Bob for his generosity and encouragement
		in our endeavour to build on his groundbreaking original work in
		event-driven history research software.</p>
