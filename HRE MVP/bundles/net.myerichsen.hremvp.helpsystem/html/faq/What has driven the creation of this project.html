	<h1>What has driven the creation of this project?</h1>

	<p>With the demise of The Master Genealogist (TMG) in 2014 the
		genealogical community  lost its last high-end product for the
		serious researcher. Stand-alone genealogical software packages are no
		longer commercially viable, and the commercial market has moved almost
		entirely to online products sold as part of a subscription to large
		family history websites. This is advantageous for the service
		provider, as it allows them to monetise your family history data, but
		many serious researchers lament the loss of the control, feature
		richness, and personal privacy that a stand-alone product can provide.</p>

	<p>Historians are very poorly served by the commercial software
		market, and frequently find themselves locked into expensive or
		inflexible academic or cultural sector packages.</p>

	<p>There is a significant level of overlap in the needs of
		genealogists and historians, and we believe that a single package
		based on common data structures could gain wide acceptance,
		particularly a package that is free and open source.</p>
