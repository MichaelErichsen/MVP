	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<a name="faq1"><h2>Project and timeline</h2></a>
	<h3>What has driven the creation of this project?</h3>
	<p>
		See <a
			href="What has driven the creation of this project.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<a name="faq2"><h3>How much will HRE cost?</h3></a>
	<p>HRE is being developed under open-source licence protocols, and
		will be free to download and install on as many computers as you wish.
		If you can, please help with donations or sponsorships. These will be
		essential to keep the project moving forward.</p>

	<a name="faq3"><h3>Who supports it?</h3></a>
	<p>As an open-source product, HRE is supported by our user
		community &ndash; so if you want to help, we&rsquo;d be glad to have
		you aboard.</p>

	<a name="faq4"><h3>Will multiple user languages be supported?</h3></a>
	<p>Yes. If you would like to help with translations into your local
		language, please volunteer.</p>

	<a name="faq5"><h3>Where can I download HRE?</h3></a>
	<p>The HRE software is a work in progress and is not yet available
		for download. if you would like to follow the progress of the project,
		and to be notified when we have software available for test, please
		join our mailing list.</p>
	<p>
		This very early mock up of HRE has probably been downloaded from <a
			href="http://www.myerichsen.net/HRE/">here</a>.
	</p>
	<a name="faq6"><h3>When do you expect to have working software
			available?</h3></a>
	<p>This will depend very much upon the number of programmers and
		other volunteer developers that we are able to attract. It is unlikely
		that we will be in a position to start beta testing before the end of
		2017.</p>

	<a name="faq7"><h3>Will I be able to get my data onto a
			website?</h3></a>
	<p>Probably not in version 1 of the software. But we recognise that
		many researchers want to be able to share their research online, and
		this is on our development list. As with TMG, we expect that third
		party software designers may want to develop independent tools for
		reading the HRE database and for uploading reports and charts to a
		website.</p>

	<a name="faq8"><h3>What about GEDCOM import?</h3></a>
	<p>As HRE is initially targeting TMG users for direct data import,
		a GEDCOM import is a lower priority item. But it is on the development
		schedule.</p>

	<a name="faq9"><h3>What areas of research are you targeting,
			apart from genealogy?</h3></a>
	<p>
		See <a href="HRE for historical and cultural research.html">HRE
			for historical and cultural research</a>.
	</p>
	<a name="faq10">
		<h2>Family history and The Master Genealogist (TMG)</h2>
	</a>
	<a name="faq11"><h3>Is HRE a new version of TMG?</h3></a>
	<p>Not at all. Although we intend that HRE will be able to import
		data from The Master genealogist (TMG), it has a wider use than the
		pure family history focus of TMG. It also implements a variety of
		concepts that go well beyond TMG&rsquo;s capabilities. Of course, if
		what you&rsquo;re looking for is a replacement for TMG we hope that
		HRE should fit that requirement, although it may not be able to
		replace all TMG functionality at first release.</p>
		
	<a name="faq12"><h3>Can I get my TMG data into HRE?</h3></a>
	<p>That is our intention, yes, as long as you are using a recent
		version of TMG (v8.05 or later).</p>
		
	<a name="faq13"><h3>Is this a Wholly Genes project?</h3></a>
	<p>No, HRE is an entirely independent project. Wholly Genes, Inc.,
		the developer of The Master Genealogist (&lsquo;TMG&lsquo;), is not
		directly involved in the HRE project and will not provide technical
		support nor assume any responsibility or liability for the project.</p>

	<p>We have, however, received kind permission from Bob Velke at
		Wholly Genes to reuse any aspects of TMG (other than the source code)
		for which they control the copyright, including underlying data
		structures, default sentence structures, modes of operation, and
		&ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>

			users of The Master Genealogist</a>.
	</p>
	
	<a name="faq14"><h2>Technical</h2></a>
	
	<a name="faq15"><h3>What hardware will the program run on?</h3></a>
	<p>HRE will be installable on Windows, Mac, and Unix/Linux
		variants.</p>
	<a name="faq16"><h3>What language is HRE written in?</h3></a>
	<p>HRE is written in Java using the SQL H2 database system. These
		choices provide us with a good level of cross-platform compatibility
		and future-proofing. They are widely supported within the software
		development community, allowing us access to a large pool of skilled
		volunteer designers and programmers.</p>
