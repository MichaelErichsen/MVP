	<h1>The HRE project</h1>

	<p>History Research Environment is a community project which aims
		to create HRE, a free and open-source platform-independent application
		for the serious amateur or professional historical researcher.</p>

	<p>HRE is designed to handle not only genealogical (family history)
		data, but a very wide range of other historical and social research
		needs.</p>

	<p>For Genealogists, HRE will provide an onward path for existing
		users of the now-discontinued program The Master Genealogist (TMG).</p>

	<p>Our project consists of a volunteer community of software
		designers, programmers, project managers, historians and genealogists
		who work together to define and create the HRE software. The community
		is supported by a not-for-profit company, History Research Environment
		Limited, which supports the community, acts as the signatory for any
		project contracts, and holds project funds.</p>

	<p>The project is entirely non-profit and volunteer-based, and we
		have no paid employees. The directors of History Research Environment
		Limited are likewise volunteers.</p>
