This project is an attempt to sketch a minimum viable product using the philosphy of the HRE data model in an extremely reduced form.
It is intended to grow into an HRE implementation, if possible.

Executable versions can be downloaded from http://www.myerichsen.net/HRE/, which also holds installation instructions.

Once installedm the product can update itself over the Internet from the update site at http://www.myerichsen.net/HRE/repository using a menu item in the product.
