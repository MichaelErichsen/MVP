This project is an attempt to sketch a minimum viable product using the philosophy of the HRE data model in an extremely reduced form.
It is intended to grow into an HRE implementation, if possible.

Executable versions for Windows (32 and 64 bit), Linux (32 and 64 bit) and Mac can be downloaded from http://www.myerichsen.net/HRE/, which also holds installation instructions.

Once installed, the product can update itself over the Internet from the update site at http://www.myerichsen.net/HRE/repository using a menu item in the product.
